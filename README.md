## Plan Outline
We plan to light 2 separate LEDs on our Breadboard using the RP20240 board. Two different LEDs will glow based on the input enetered by the user on the keyboard. When the 'C' key is pressed, the Green LED lights up. When the 'D' key is pressed, the Blue LED lights up. We use serial communication for controlling our LED this way.

## Components Used:
- Breadboard
- STEMMA QT Cable
- 1k ohm and 100 ohm Resistors
- Blue LED
- Green LED
- Adafruit QTPy: RP2040
