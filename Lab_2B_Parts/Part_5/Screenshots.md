# I2C Traffic

- I2C is a serial communication protocol where the `SCL` and clock drives the communication between nodes.
- We set the Oscilloscope to the `Digital` mode for better readings.
- We used Logic Analyzers and normal probes to observe the digital signals.

Below are the screenshots showing the I2C traffic between the Adafruit QTPy RP2040 and the APDS9960.
